# Petfolio
An application that allows users to upload and organize information about their pets.

## Motivation
Many pet owners have hundreds of photos of their pet.  This app was created to assist pet owners in organizing their photos as well as storing important information about their pets (such as medications) so that the information can be quickly accessed.
